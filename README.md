# Learn Spring Framework – Notes, Examples & Teaching Extensions

This repository is my curated learning space for mastering the Spring Framework and related tools (Spring Boot, JPA, Spring Security, etc.).

It is **not tied to any one course or tutorial**, but instead brings together notes, code examples, and lesson ideas based on multiple sources.

## 📦 What’s included:
- 🧠 Core Spring concepts (IoC, DI, Beans, Annotations)
- 🧪 Hands-on mini projects and exercises
- 🧑‍🏫 Teaching resources: quiz questions, classroom tasks, project outlines
- 📚 Course-specific insights (e.g. in28minutes, Polish Udemy courses)
- 📖 A growing glossary of Spring terminology

## 📚 References – Course-Specific Notes

The `references/` directory contains **course-dependent notes and summaries**.
These files document my progress and thoughts while working through specific learning resources or tutorials.

Each reference:
- includes only original, handwritten notes and reflections,
- does **not** reproduce full course content,
- is credited with a course name and (if applicable) link to the source.

### Examples:
- `in28minutes-master-spring.md` – notes based on the popular Udemy course by in28minutes
- `another-spring-course.md` – notes from another Spring course or book
